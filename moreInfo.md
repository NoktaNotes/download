## About Nokta
Nokta is a personal project, my attempt at creating my own perfect note app. Clean, fast, and no clutter. I wanted something simple: a straightforwared editor, flexible note organization, and no unnecessary features getting in the way. Nokta is the result.
This is a one-person project, developed in my spare time. I use it daily myself, which is the best motivation to keep improving it.
